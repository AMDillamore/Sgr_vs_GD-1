# Sgr_vs_GD-1

Example scripts for the paper 'The impact of a massive Sagittarius dSph on GD-1-like streams' by Adam M. Dillamore, Vasily Belokurov, N. Wyn Evans and Adrian M. Price-Whelan.

Sgr_orbit.py: generates LMC and Sgr orbits in a triaxial MW potential, with a range of Sgr mass decay rates. Reproduces Figure 1 in the paper.

acc_extra3.txt: file needed for calculation of LMC orbit (from calibration with N-body simulations).

GC_streams.py: generates mock streams from three globular clusters using Lagrange Cloud Stripping, with a range of Sgr mass decay rates. Reproduces Figure 2 in the paper.

Pal5.py: generates mock streams from the Pal 5 cluster with different Sgr mass decay rates. Reproduces Figure 3 in the paper.

dist_data.py: calculates and plots the distances of the RRL and BHB stars in the GD-1 stream. See the paper for references and more details.

gd1-RRL.fits, gd1-BHB.fits: files containing data for the RRL and BHB stars respectively.
